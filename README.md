## Code Overview ðŸ“š

The main component is `App`, which manages the state of the game, including the dice and whether the player has won. It uses the `Die` component to render each die.

The `Die` component takes a `value` prop which represents the value of the die, and an `isHeld` prop which determines whether the die is held. When a die is clicked, it toggles its `isHeld` state.

The game uses the `nanoid` library to generate unique IDs for each die, and the `react-confetti` library to display confetti when the player wins.
